Hybrid Test
========

This test uses input files from the "Phosphate Film Growth from TCP on Fe110" example. It ensures that PAPRECA can be normally initialized from complex input files
and guarantees that the PAPRECA version can normally execute hybrid kMC/MD runs of different classes of predefined events.

Running the Hybrid test
========

You can run the hybrid test using the "test_hybrid.sh" script located within the "hybrid kMC MD" folder:

```bash
bash test_hybrid.sh /path/to/your/papreca/executable/
```
